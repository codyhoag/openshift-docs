You can update, or upgrade, an {product-title} cluster by using the web console.

.Prerequisites

* Have access to the cluster as a user with `admin` privileges.
See xref:../authentication/using-rbac.adoc[Using RBAC to define and apply permissions].
* Have a recent xref:../backup_and_restore/backing-up-etcd.adoc#backup-etcd[etcd backup] in case your upgrade fails and you must xref:../backup_and_restore/disaster_recovery/scenario-2-restoring-cluster-state.adoc#dr-restoring-cluster-state[restore your cluster to a previous state].

// The following note should not be needed come 4.4 docs

// Assuming next z-streams:
// from {product-title} 4.1.31 or earlier; as of {product-title} 4.1.34
// from {product-title} 4.2.16 or earlier; as of {product-title} 4.2.18

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you are upgrading to this release from {product-title} 4.3.3 or earlier, you must restart all Pods after the upgrade is complete.

This is because the service CA is automatically rotated as of {product-title} 4.3.5. The service CA is rotated during the upgrade and a restart is required afterward to ensure that all services are using the new service CA before the previous service CA expires.

After this one-time manual restart, subsequent upgrades and rotations will ensure restart before the service CA expires without requiring manual intervention.
