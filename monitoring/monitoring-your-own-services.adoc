You can use OpenShift Monitoring for your own services in addition to monitoring the cluster. This way, you do not need to use an additional monitoring solution. This helps keeping monitoring centralized.
Additionally, you can extend the access to the metrics of your services beyond cluster administrators. This enables developers and arbitrary users to access these metrics.

[NOTE]
====
Opting into monitoring your own services is mutually exclusive with either a custom installation of Prometheus Operator or installing Prometheus Operator using Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM).
