= Using triggers with Knative Eventing

toc::[]

All events which are sent to a channel or broker will be sent to all subscribers of that channel or broker by default.

Using triggers allows you to filter events from a channel or broker, so that subscribers will only receive a subset of events based on your defined criteria.

The Knative CLI provides a set of `kn trigger` commands that can be used to create and manage triggers.

.Prerequisites
Before you can use triggers, you will need:

* Knative Eventing and `kn` installed.
* An available broker, either the `default` broker or one that you have created.
* An available event consumer, for example, a Knative service.

.Example trigger YAML:

----
apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Trigger
metadata:
  name: trigger-example <1>
spec:
 broker: default <2>
 subscriber:
    ref:
      apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
      kind: Service
      name: my-service <3>
----

<1> The name of the trigger being created.
<2> The name of the broker where events will be filtered from. If the broker is not specified, the trigger will revert to using the `default` Broker.
<3> The name of the service that will consumer filtered events.
