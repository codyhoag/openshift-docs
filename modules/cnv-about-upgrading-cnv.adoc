= About upgrading container-native virtualization

If you enabled automatic updates when you installed {CNVProductName}, you
receive updates as they become available.

== How {CNVProductName} upgrades work

* Only _z-stream_ updates are available. For example, you can upgrade from {CNVVersion}.0 to {CNVVersion}.1.

* Updates are delivered via the _Marketplace Operator_, which is deployed
during {product-title} installation. The Marketplace Operator makes
external Operators available to your cluster.

* The amount of time an update takes to complete depends on your network
connection. Most automatic updates complete within fifteen minutes.

== How {CNVProductName} upgrades affect your cluster

* Upgrading does not interrupt virtual machine workloads.
** Virtual machine Pods are not restarted or migrated during an upgrade. If you
need to update the `virt-launcher` Pod, you must restart or live migrate the
virtual machine.
+
[NOTE]
====
Each virtual machine has a `virt-launcher` Pod that runs the virtual machine
instance. The `virt-launcher` Pod runs an instance of `libvirt`, which is
used to manage the virtual machine process.
====

* Upgrading does not interrupt network connections.

* DataVolumes and their associated PersistentVolumeClaims are preserved during
upgrade.
