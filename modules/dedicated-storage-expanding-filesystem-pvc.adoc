= Expanding {product-name} Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs)

Expanding PVCs based on volume types that need file system re-sizing,
such as AWS EBS, is a two-step process.
This process involves expanding volume objects in the cloud provider and
then expanding the file system on the actual node. These steps occur automatically
after the PVC object is edited and might require a Pod restart to take effect.

Expanding the file system on the node only happens when a new Pod is started
with the volume.

.Prerequisites

* The controlling StorageClass must have `allowVolumeExpansion` set
to `true`. This is the default configuration in {product-name}.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Decreasing the size of an Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume is not supported. However, you
can create a smaller volume and then migrate your data to it by using a
tool such as `oc rsync`. After modifying a volume, you must wait at least six hours before
making additional modifications to the same volume.
====

.Procedure

. Edit the PVC and request a new size by editing
the `spec.resources.requests.storage` parameter. The following PVC example sets
the `ebs` PVC to 8 Gi.
+
[source,yaml]
----
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: ebs
spec:
  storageClass: "gp2"
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 8Gi <1>
----
<1> Updating `spec.resources.requests.storage` to a larger amount expands
the PVC.
+
You can do this with a simple `oc patch` command:
+
----
$ oc patch pvc ebs -p '{"spec": {"resources": {"requests": {"storage": "8Gi"}}}}'
----

. Once the cloud provider object has finished re-sizing, the PVC is set to
`FileSystemResizePending`. The following command is used to check
the condition:
+
----
$ oc describe pvc <pvc_name>
----
+
This condition may resolve automatically, or in some cases you will see
a message indicating that the Pod will need to be restarted first:
+
----
Conditions:
  Type                     Status  LastProbeTime      LastTransitionTime  Reason  Message
  ----                     ------  -----------------  ------------------  ------  -------
  FileSystemResizePending  True    <Timestamp>        <Timestamp>                 Waiting for user to (re-)start a Pod to
                                                                                  finish file system resize of volume on node.
----
+
When you see this specific message, you will need to restart the mounting Pod. This is
also exposed in the `describe` command above:
+
----
Mounted By:  mysql-1-2cb7q
----
+
The quickest way to do this is by deleting the Pod and letting {product-name}
provision a replacement Pod.

. Once the Pod is running, the newly requested size is available and the
`FileSystemResizePending` condition is removed from the PVC.
