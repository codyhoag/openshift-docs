= Uploading a local disk image to a new DataVolume

You can use the `virtctl` CLI utility to upload a virtual machine disk image from
a client machine to a DataVolume (DV) in your cluster. After you upload the image, 
you can add it to a virtual machine.

.Prerequisites

* A virtual machine disk image, in RAW, ISO, or QCOW2 format, optionally
compressed by using `xz` or `gz`.
* The `kubevirt-virtctl` package must be installed on the client machine.
* The client machine must be configured to trust the {product-title} router's
certificate.
* A spare DataVolume that is the same size or larger than the disk that you are uploading.

.Procedure

. Identify the following items:
** File location of the VM disk image that you want to upload
** Name of the DataVolume

. Run the `virtctl image-upload` command to upload your disk image.
You must specify the DV name and file location. For example:
+
----
$ virtctl image-upload --dv-name=<upload-datavolume> --image-path=</images/fedora.qcow2> <1> <2>
----
<1> The name of the DataVolume that you are creating.
<2> The filepath of the virtual machine disk image you are uploading.

[CAUTION]
====
To allow insecure server connections when using HTTPS, use the `--insecure`
parameter. Be aware that when you use the `--insecure` flag, the authenticity of
the upload endpoint is *not* verified.

. To verify that the DV was created, view all DV objects:
