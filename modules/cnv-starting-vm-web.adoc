= Starting a virtual machine

You can start a virtual machine from the web console.

.Procedure

. In the {CNVProductName} console, click *Workloads* -> *Virtual Machines*.
. Start the virtual machine from this screen, which makes it easier to perform
actions on multiple virtual machines in the one screen, or from
the *Virtual Machine Details* screen where you can view comprehensive details of
the selected virtual machine:
** Click the Options menu {kebab} at the end of virtual machine and select
*Start Virtual Machine*.
** Click the virtual machine name to open the *Virtual Machine Details* screen
and click *Actions* and select *Start Virtual Machine*.
. In the confirmation window, click *Start* to start the virtual machine.

[NOTE]
====
When you start virtual machine that is provisioned from a `URL` source for the
first time, the virtual machine is in the *Importing* state while {CNVProductName}
imports the container from the URL endpoint. Depending on the size of the image,
this process might take several minutes.
