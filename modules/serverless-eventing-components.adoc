= Knative Eventing components

Event source:: Event sources are Kubernetes custom resources that provide a mechanism for registering interest in a class of events from an event producer.

// Add 'Channel' / 'Sinks / consumers'

Broker:: A broker represents an event mesh. Events are sent to the broker's ingress and are then sent to any event consumers that are subscribed to that broker.
After the event is in the broker, metadata for the event is stripped away so that there is no information about how the event entered the broker.
+
.Example broker YAML definition
----
apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Broker
metadata:
  name: default <1>
spec:
  channelTemplateSpec: <2>
    apiVersion: messaging.knative.dev/v1alpha1
    kind: InMemoryChannel
----

<1> The `default` broker is provided with your {ServerlessProductName} Knative Eventing installation.
<2> Event channels can be specified in the `channelTemplateSpec`.

// NOTE: this is being replaced. Update when details are available upstream.


Trigger:: A trigger enables a Knative service to subscribe to events from a specific broker.
+
.Example trigger YAML definition
----
apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Trigger
metadata:
  name: my-service-trigger <1>
spec:
  broker: default <2>
  subscriber: <3>
    ref:
      apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
      kind: Service
      name: my-service
----

<1> The name of the trigger.
<2> Specifies the name of the broker that the trigger will listen for events from.
<3> The `subscriber` section defines the Knative service that the broker sends events to.
