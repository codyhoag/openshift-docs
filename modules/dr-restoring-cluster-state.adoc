= Restoring to a previous cluster state

You can use a saved etcd backup to restore back to a previous cluster state.

.Prerequisites

* Access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* SSH access to master hosts.
* A backup directory containing both the etcd snapshot and static Kubernetes API server resources taken from the same backup. The file names in the directory must be in the following formats: `snapshot_<datetimestamp>.db` and `static_kuberesources_<datetimestamp>.tar.gz`.
+
[NOTE]
====
You must use the same etcd backup directory on all master hosts in the cluster.
====

.Procedure

. Prepare each master host in your cluster to be restored.
+
You should run the restore script on all of your master hosts within a short period of time so that the cluster members come up at about the same time and form a quorum. For this reason, it is recommended to stage each master host in a separate terminal, so that the restore script can then be started quickly on each.

.. Copy the etcd backup directory to a master host.
+
This procedure assumes that you copied the `backup` directory containing the etcd snapshot and static Kubernetes API server resources to the `/home/core/` directory of your master host.

.. Access the master host.

.. Set the `INITIAL_CLUSTER` variable to the list of members in the format of `<name>=<url>`. This variable will be passed to the restore script and must be exactly the same for each member.
+
----
[core@ip-10-0-143-125 ~]$ export INITIAL_CLUSTER="etcd-member-ip-10-0-143-125.ec2.internal=https://etcd-0.clustername.devcluster.openshift.com:2380,etcd-member-ip-10-0-35-108.ec2.internal=https://etcd-1.clustername.devcluster.openshift.com:2380,etcd-member-ip-10-0-10-16.ec2.internal=https://etcd-2.clustername.devcluster.openshift.com:2380"
----

.. Repeat these steps on your other master hosts, each in a separate terminal. Be sure to use the backup directory containing the same set of backup files on each master host.

. Run the restore script on all of your master hosts.

.. Start the `etcd-snapshot-restore.sh` script on your first master host. Pass in two parameters: the path to the etcd backup directory and list of members, which is defined by the `INITIAL_CLUSTER` variable.

.. Once the restore starts, run the script on your other master hosts.

. Verify that the Machine Configs have been applied.
+
In a terminal that has access to the cluster as a `cluster-admin` user, run the following command.
+
----
$ oc get machineconfigpool
NAME     CONFIG                                             UPDATED   UPDATING

----
+
When the snapshot has been applied, the `currentConfig` of the master will match the ID from when the etcd snapshot was taken. The `currentConfig` name for masters is in the format `rendered-master-<currentConfig>`.

. Verify that all master hosts have started and joined the cluster.

.. Access a master host and connect to the running etcd container.

.. In the etcd container, execute `etcdctl member list` and verify that the three members show as started.
