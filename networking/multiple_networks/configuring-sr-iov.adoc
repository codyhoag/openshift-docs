== About SR-IOV hardware on {product-title}

{product-title} includes the capability to use SR-IOV hardware on your nodes.
You can attach SR-IOV virtual function (VF) interfaces to Pods on nodes with SR-IOV hardware.

You can use the {product-title} console to install SR-IOV by deploying the
SR-IOV Network Operator. The SR-IOV Network Operator creates and manages the
components of the SR-IOV stack. The Operator provides following features:

* Discover the SR-IOV network device in cluster.
* Initialize the supported SR-IOV NIC models on nodes.
* Provision the SR-IOV network device plug-in on nodes.
* Provision the SR-IOV CNI plug-in executable on nodes.
* Provision the Network Resources Injector in cluster.
* Manage configuration of SR-IOV network device plug-in.
* Generate NetworkAttachmentDefinition custom resources (CR) for the SR-IOV CNI
plug-in.

Here's the function of each above mentioned SR-IOV components.

* The SR-IOV network device plug-in is a Kubernetes device plug-in for
discovering, advertising, and allocating SR-IOV network virtual function (VF)
resources. Device plug-ins are used in Kubernetes to enable the use of limited
resources, typically in physical devices. Device plug-ins give the Kubernetes
scheduler awareness of resource availability, so the scheduler can schedule Pods on nodes with sufficient resources.

* The SR-IOV CNI plug-in plumbs VF interfaces allocated from the SR-IOV device
plug-in directly into a Pod.

* The Network Resources Injector is a Kubernetes Dynamic Admission Controller
Webhook that provides functionality for patching Kubernetes Pod specifications
with requests and limits for custom network resources such as SR-IOV VFs.

[NOTE]
====
The Network Resources Injector is enabled by default and cannot be disabled.

The Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK) is a Technology Preview feature only.
Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service
level agreements (SLAs), might not be functionally complete, and Red Hat does
not recommend to use them for production. These features provide early access to
upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide
feedback during the development process.
