== About this release

// Copied from 4.3; update when more information is available.

Red Hat {product-title}
(link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2020:1234[RHBA-2020:1234]) is now
available. This release uses link:https://v1-17.docs.kubernetes.io/docs/setup/release/notes/[Kubernetes 1.17] with CRI-O runtime. New features, changes, and known issues that pertain to
{product-title} {product-version} are included in this topic.

application for {product-title} allows you to deploy OpenShift clusters to
either on-premise or cloud environments.

{product-title} {product-version} is supported on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6 or
later, as well as Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS 4.3.

You must use {op-system-first} for the control plane, or master, machines and
can use either {op-system} or Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6 or later for
compute, or worker, machines.

This release adds improvements related to the following components and concepts.

=== Telemetry

[id="ocp-4-4-insights-operator-anonymized-csr"]
==== Insights Operator now collects anonymized CSRs

With this enhancement, Insights Operator periodically collects anonymized
certificate signing requests (CSR) to identify CSRs that are not verified in
Kubernetes or have not been approved. Additionally, Insights Operator collects
data if certificates are valid. As a result, this helps to improve the OpenShift
customer support experience.
